1. API Implementation Guidelines:
   - These endpoints are implemented by the WordPress plugin and require the MemberPress Developer Tools add-on
   - Authentication works through WordPress API keys
   - All endpoints use the base URL: `/wp-json/mp/v1/`
   - This documentation describes self-hosted usage, not a SaaS service

2. Documentation Usage:
   - Code examples provided are for educational purposes
   - Endpoints may vary based on plugin version
   - Examples should be customized for specific WordPress implementations
   - All API interactions occur within the user's own WordPress installation
